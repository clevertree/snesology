# About Page

The SNESology/AudioSource project is free for everyone. It is also open source, so anyone can join in the development.

SNESology was originally created by Shnabubula (as a music album) to celebrate the music that came from the SNES.
Later, it became a blog to post SNESology & SNES related music and albums maintained by Katie Kinkel and others.

Currently, The SNESology project has been restarted as a free, open-source Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) called "Audio Source Composer", that runs on any modern browser.
This DAW will focus on the original chiptune sound (and more) and will allow users to create, edit, and publish their own songs.
