## Q: Why doesn't this composer have a standard MIDI note editor?
A primary goal of Audio Source Composer is to provide a song 'source' view which is easy to read and edit. This is why ASC's primary track view is top-down "tracker" style. Another limitation is the ability to render both an HTML-based track view and a native mobile one as well. 

## So, will there be a standard MIDI note editor interface?
Absolutely! First things first.
