# About


The SNESology and AudioSource Project is free for everyone. It is also open source, so anyone can join in the development.

SNESology was originally created by Shnabubula (as a music album) to celebrate the music that came from the SNES.
Later, it became a blog to post SNESology & SNES related music and albums maintained by Katie Kinkel and others.

Currently, The SNESology Project has been restarted as a free, open-source Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) called [i]Audio Source Composer[/i], that runs on any modern browser.
This DAW will focus on the original chiptune sound (and more) and will allow users to create, edit, and publish their own songs.

## FAQ

### Q: Why doesn't this composer have a standard (left-to-right) MIDI note editor?
A primary goal of Audio Source Composer is to provide a song 'source' view which is easy to read and edit. This is why ASC's primary track view is top-down "tracker" style. Another limitation is the ability to render both an HTML-based track view and a native mobile one as well. Once this is solved, it will be possible to design an all-platform left-to-right or top-to-bottom standard MIDI note editor
