# About Page

The SNESology and AudioSource Project is free for everyone. It is also open source, so anyone can join in the development.

SNESology was originally created by Shnabubula (as a music album) to celebrate the music that came from the SNES.
From there, it evolved into a blog to post SNESology & SNES related music and albums, maintained by Monobrow and others.

At that time, SNESology released sample sets in various formats, to emulate the SNES sound on modern platforms. SNESology musicians used these sets (and others) to make songs that were posted on the blog. Protricity was also approached at this time to make a sample library / VSTi for SNES samples, that would be released by SNESology in the future.

Currently, The SNESology Project has been restarted as a free, open-source Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) called [i]Audio Source Composer[/i], that runs on any modern browser.
This DAW will focus on the original chiptune sound (and more) and will allow users to create, edit, and publish their own songs.
