## Features: <a name="features"></a>
* Works on any modern browser on any phone, tablet or PC.
* Instruments and effects can be wrapped in each other to build complex presets.
* Note tracks can be called recursively for a highly structured song.

### What's Currently Working:
* Add, edit, and delete notes and note tracks
* Edit note velocity and duration
* Quarter tone compatibility (missing in MIDI)
* Recursively play back tracks by adding a 'track note'
* Track note transposing (play back tracks at different frequencies)

### Under the Hood:
* Audio Source brings the WebAudio API to mobile by using a WebView as a proxy.
* Songs, instruments, and samples written for Audio Source will work on any platform. 
* Instruments render using React VirtualDOM on the UI thread while rendering audio in the WebView proxy. 

### Planned Features:
* Sample libraries
* Audio recording and editing
* Track XY Grid for easy mouse-click composition
* Real-time editing between multiple users (like Google Docs)
* Server-side song rendering
* Import/Export MIDI files
