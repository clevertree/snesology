Open-Source means the AudioSource project is free forever; anyone can assist.
We're looking for testers, artists, and musicians to 
[contribute](https://github.com/clevertree/audio-source-composer/issues/4).
Currently the composer is in
[active development](https://github.com/clevertree/audio-source-composer)
and has not yet been released.
If you want to join up, please contact us on the 
[GitHub page](https://github.com/clevertree).

Check back for updates as we get closer to the Beta release!
